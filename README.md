# Fox Pet

Hi! I'm Hyrlost. I just want to let you know what the mod is.
It is a mod where the fox gets some properties from the wolf, where we can tame them with sweet berries, with that, the fox will follow us and will atack with us. Our best friend!

It seems simple, but actually it could be very reusable, specially with the goals I created to adapt the wolf behavior into the fox behavior, right now it is just usable for the foxes, but with minimal and very fast changes, we can reuse it so much, it lets us to make a lot of entities into our friends! :D

If you want to contact me, please add me on discord Hyrlost#6321.
